## [0.1.2] - 08/11/2018

Refactoring patch - plot, animate and edge attributes.

### Added

- Animation method to show, with explanation, how the camera's edge is being estimated.
- Method that combines Edges in the network can now be 'enriched' with additional attributes: bearing, grade (calculated from node elevation), address details (road, suburb, postcode - outer and inner, OSM importance metric, type)
- Address details can be added as attributes to every edge in the network
- Address details, of up to 50 osmids, can be retrived from Nominatim
- Dead end nodes can be retrieved and removed from the network graph.
- Further control parameters to the method plot_camera

### Changed
- Increased default value for 'mean_area' to 0.3 km^2 in `anprx.navigation.get_surrounding_network`
- Adjusted log indentation
- Moved camera.plot method to a separate source file - the method is now called plot_camera

### Removed
- Removed import * from anprx submodules `__init__.py`

### Refactored
- navigation.py source file - moved to core.py
- anprx imports in test files
- `__init__.py` now imports anprx submodules

	- Plot the street network around the camera and highlight nearby nodes and candidate edges based on their computed probability.
- Plots are saved to images folder in app's folder.
